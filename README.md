# ewk_optimization  

This repository contains everything needed for optimization of the ATLAS SUSY Wh qqbb analysis. It takes as inputs flat (signal and background) ROOT ntuples, applies a lot of cuts according a "supercuts.json" file, and automatically figures out the most optimal selection for maximizing the significance. It also contains a few scripts for making 2D plots of the significance and optimal cuts at different mass points. It is essentially just a fork of [Optimization](https://github.com/kratsg/Optimization) by Giordon Stark.
